While security researchers demonstrate their ranks in various bounty programms and threat hunters share yet another thrilling story of tracking and pinning down an APTs, avarage security engineers stay in the shadows. Most of our work is under NDA and IP rights belong to the companies we work for hence can hardly be presented to the world. Since one can't demonstrate his actual "kingdom" why not to build a mock-up one with all the bells and whistles. The benefits are obvious:

- Save time during job interviews and skills assessments. Just give your interviewers access to your setup and code.

- Gather a collection on blueprints for use in future projects

- Have fun, experiment, try to break your own guardrails, learn new things.

I've also noticed that the majority of similar projects like [CloudGoat](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat) or [GCPGoat](https://github.com/ine-labs/GCPGoat) focus on breaking stuff rather than building the systems properly from grounds up. Through this series of posts, I will take you through the various stages of the project, from planning and design to implementation and compliance verification. We will go over the details on how to setp the infrastructure and establsih security controls to protect it and, including access control, network segmentation, intrusion detection and prevention, and continuous monitoring. Moreover there will be bits on what evidence of operationl controls for future audits and certifications, an important yet most overlooked topic in the majority of the tutorials.

<h2>What Are We Building</h2>

## What Are We Building

We are going to deploy Techschool's [Simple Bank](https://github.com/techschool/simplebank) backend service along with the supporting infrastructure and secury tooling. While the original course covers a lot of devops related topics such as containerising apps, uploading images to the ECR and deploying them to the AWS EKS, it's main focus is still on software development, hence most of the provided recipies are aimed at simply getting your code up and running. We will spice it up with some AWS Well Architected Framework practices and DevSecOps.

> I do recommend though to go through the whole Techschool's [course](https://www.youtube.com/c/TECHSCHOOLGURU) anyway. This will add a lot to your understanding of modern application stack!

Inside our AWS Organazation we are going to have the following Org Units:
- **Deployment OU** - OU that hosts another special account that hosts TF state, an Atlantis worker (special instance that pulls the IaC code form the repository and deploys it to other accounts) together with cross account access roles.
- **Infrastructure OU** - OU that hosts accounts reserved for self-hosted infa/devops-ish stuff like Keycloak, Jenkins, Prometheus and etc.
- **Sandbox OU** - OU that hosts Accounts for developers either randomly allocated or one per developer go here. This project just adds one generic account.
- **Security OU** - OU that hosts security related accounts including logging accounts and security tools.
- **Production OU** - This is where our production application and customer facing workloads go.

## Before We Begin

Let's get to work and start coding... some diagrams first. Sadly, despite all the shift-somewhere manifestos and DevSecOps buzz, in 2023, the PCI Council, and hence the majority of security auditors, consider a drawing to be the primary source of truth for the organization, not your infrastracture code (see PCI DSS 4.0 Req 1.2.3). Even sadder, in 2023, the problem of automating the net/infra diagram drawing still presists.

When I first confronted it, I thought that it should be pretty easy to take a Terraform state and convert it into diagrams, right? Surprisingly, there is a whole bunch of questions that has no good answer.

- How do you draw the relations that are not even described in the state file?
- What if you use Pulumi instead?
- What if your state drifts or not all parts of your infra exist as code?

Maybe we could query the cloud API instead and get all the resources? Except as far as I know, itâ€™s still next to impossible to get a full and adequate list of resources and their interconnections from the AWS API.
Bizzare fact - the best solution here is  [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke) a tool designed to completely wipe your AWS accounts. Quel bordel!

There are some commercial tools that are capable of fully automated (to some extent) diagram creation form both source and API. Worth noting are [cloudviz](https://cloudviz.io), [cloudcraft](https://www.cloudcraft.co/) and [hava](https://www.hava.io). However, convincing management to allocate budget for these tools can be challenging, as they are often perceived as 'beautifiers' rather than essential investments. Here are some compelling reasons to support the case for investing in such tools. It generally takes about a week of time and 2 engineers to go thtough all the infra/code and create the diagram. This is done primarily for a demonstration of compliance to the auditors once a year. The diagram needs constant revision and updating. Since for your engineers the code is the primary source of truth the diagram will be at least 1-2 versions behind what's actually in place. Double the abovementioned expences.
>Considering a devops labor cost of $70 per hour, with 8 hours a day for 7 days involving 2 engineers, the total cost amounts to $7,840. This is a substantial expense, even when compared to the costliest enterprise plans of the mentioned commercial tools.

For our purposes we'll use [Diagrams as Code](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/).

> Please note that this tool is also far from perfect when drawing big and complicated infrastructures and you might get back to good-old manual draw.io, Lucidchart or Visio.
{: .prompt-tip }
Install the tooling with `pip3 install diagrams`, clone the [repo](https://github.com/h0c0b/mockup-bank-docs), run `python <diagram-name>.py` whenever you make changes to the diagram code.
This piece of code...

```python
from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.management import OrganizationsAccount, OrganizationsOrganizationalUnit, Organizations

graph_attr = {
    "splines": "spline",
}

with Diagram("AWS Accounts Layout", outformat=["jpg"], filename="../img/acc_arch", direction='LR'):
    org_root = Organizations ("MockUpBank Org")
    ou_infra = OrganizationsOrganizationalUnit("Infra OU")
    ou_security = OrganizationsOrganizationalUnit("Security OU")
    ou_prod = OrganizationsOrganizationalUnit ("Prod OU")
    ou_sandbox = OrganizationsOrganizationalUnit ("Sandbox OU")
    master_acc = OrganizationsAccount ("root")
    deploy_acc = OrganizationsAccount ("Deployment account")
    sec_acc = OrganizationsAccount ("Security account")
    log_acc = OrganizationsAccount ("Log Archive")
    dev_acc = OrganizationsAccount ("Dev Acc")
    prod_acc = OrganizationsAccount ("Production")
    org_root - master_acc
    org_root - ou_infra 
    org_root - ou_security 
    org_root - ou_prod
    org_root - ou_sandbox

    ou_infra - deploy_acc
    ou_security - sec_acc
    ou_security - log_acc
    ou_sandbox - dev_acc
    ou_prod - prod_acc
```

...will generate you this pretty picture:
